Feature: shopsystem-scenarios — canonicalization and CLI contracts

  # NOTE: the @scenario_hash and @bc tags are intentionally on separate
  # lines. This scenario's hash (fc3de5729689666d) was computed with the
  # @bc tag KEPT in the canonical body — only the @scenario_hash line is
  # dropped by canonicalization. Collapsing the two tags onto one line
  # would drop @bc with it and change the hash to d7467ae580e1d8bf.

  Scenario: scenarios list prints each scenario's title alongside its @scenario_hash value for a feature file
    Given a feature file containing two scenarios, each preceded by a "@scenario_hash:" tag line carrying that scenario's hash
    When I run "scenarios list" against that feature file
    Then the exit code is 0
    And stdout contains a line pairing the first scenario's title with its @scenario_hash value
    And stdout contains a line pairing the second scenario's title with its @scenario_hash value
    And stderr is empty
