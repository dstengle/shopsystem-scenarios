  @scenario_hash:d7467ae580e1d8bf
  Scenario: scenarios list prints each scenario's title alongside its @scenario_hash value for a feature file
    Given a feature file containing two scenarios, each preceded by a "@scenario_hash:" tag line carrying that scenario's hash
    When I run "scenarios list" against that feature file
    Then the exit code is 0
    And stdout contains a line pairing the first scenario's title with its @scenario_hash value
    And stdout contains a line pairing the second scenario's title with its @scenario_hash value
    And stderr is empty
