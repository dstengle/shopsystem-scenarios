Feature: shopsystem-scenarios — canonicalization and CLI contracts

  # @scenario_hash and @bc are intentionally on separate lines: this
  # scenario's hash was computed with @bc KEPT in the canonical body
  # (only the @scenario_hash line is dropped by canonicalization).

  Scenario: scenarios titles prints each scenario's title one per line for a feature file
    Given a feature file containing two scenarios with distinct titles
    When I run "scenarios titles" against that feature file
    Then the exit code is 0
    And stdout's first line is the first scenario's title
    And stdout's second line is the second scenario's title
    And stderr is empty
