Feature: shopsystem-scenarios — scenarios tags CLI contract

  # @scenario_hash and @bc are intentionally on separate lines: this
  # scenario's hash was computed with @bc KEPT in the canonical body
  # (only the @scenario_hash line is dropped by canonicalization).

  @bc:shopsystem-scenarios
  Scenario: scenarios tags prints the distinct @-tags across a feature file one per line
    Given a feature file whose scenarios carry two distinct @-tags, one of them repeated
    When I run "scenarios tags" against that feature file
    Then the exit code is 0
    And stdout lists each distinct @-tag exactly once, one tag per line
    And stderr is empty
